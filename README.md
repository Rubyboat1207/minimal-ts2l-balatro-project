# How to use

1. Modify the package.json to fit your project
2. run ``npm install``
3. to build and install, run ``npm run build``
4. you need steammoded to just like get that i guess
5. Game code runs in index.ts
6. Generally, I'll put any lovely patches in the /src/game_events.ts folder
7. If you want to use lua things, just define them in the .d.ts file
8. I'm really lazy, and dont feel like finishing this guide. Talk to me on discord @rubyboat if you ever want to use this project.

Check out my mod made in lua, not Typescript which is my versus mod
